<h3><strong>It’s not quite as religious as you think</strong></h3>
<p>Despite the importance of religion in Spanish culture, apparently only 13.6% of Spain’s population actually goes to church every Sunday. That said, some 70% of the locals still identify as Roman Catholic according to a 2012 study by the Center for Sociological Studies in Spain.</p>

<h3><strong>The ‘first’ novel was written in Spanish</strong></h3>
<p>Back in 1605, Miguel de Cervantes wrote Don Quixote, widely considered to be the world’s first modern novel. The seminal book is seen as one of the most important pieces of Spanish literature ever written and is a founding work of Western literature.</p>

<h3><strong>The winds of change</strong></h3>
<p>Spain leads the way when it comes to renewable energy. In fact, it was the first country in the world to have wind as the greatest source of its electricity. Back in 2013, wind turbines generated just under 54,000-gigawatt-hours of electricity – a fifth of the nation’s usage.</p>

<h3><strong>150,000 tomatoes are thrown every year…</strong></h3>
<p>… at the legendary La Tomatina festival. Held every August, the festival sees revelers from around the world descend on the small town of Buñol, near Valencia. Visitors are encouraged to throw as many tomatoes as they can – but only once they been squashed, to avoid any injuries.</p>

<h3><strong>The Spanish are a tolerant society</strong></h3>
<p>Back in 2010, the European Social Survey found that 80% of respondents agreed that ‘gay men and lesbians should be free to live their own lives.’ This compares to less than 40% of Croatians, Lithuanians, and Russians. Spain has a large LGBT community, and same-sex marriage has been legal since 2005.</p>

<h3><strong>The perfect place to let your hair down</strong></h3>
<p>Spain is a country full of festivals. As well as La Tomatina, the country has a wide range of kooky Spanish festivals to check out. You can be chased by bulls during the festivals of San Fermin, watch huge ninots (statues) get burnt during Las Fallas, or soak up some history at Romería de Nuesra Señora de le Cabeza. There’s never a dull moment in this sunny country!</p>
