<h1>Language Learning Tips</h1>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you learn Spanish:</p>

<p>
<h2><strong>Tips for Learning Spanish by Reading</strong></h2>

<h3>Read Spanish magazines and newspapers online</h3>
<p>It’s the combination of short stories and snippets together with feature-length pieces that make Spanish magazines and newspapers such a great resource for learning Spanish. If you’re new to this Spanish language game, or you just have 5 minutes to spare over a café con leche, have a quick read.</p>

<p><strong>In practice:</strong> <a href="https://shop.multilingualbooks.com/pages/learn-spanish-with-online-magazines"><i>Multilingual Books</i></a> has dozens of free newspapers and magazines online, from Mexico’s <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/"><i>El Economista</i></a>, <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/"><i>El Mundo</i></a> (from Madrid), and <a href="https://www.elle.com/es/"><i>Elle</i></a>. To keep up momentum, commit to reading one article, column or snippet a day.</p>


<h3>Try a Spanish recipe written in Spanish</h3>
<p>Instead of just cooking a native Spanish or Latin America dish, why not cook an entire meal from Spanish recipes, with all of the ingredients and instructions written in Spanish?</p>

<p><strong>In practice:</strong> If you’re not sure where to start, <a href="https://www.mycolombianrecipes.com/es/"><i>My Colombian Recipes</i></a> has some tasty looking choices, and there are plenty of pictures so you’ll know just what to aim for with your final dish.</p>


<h3>Get a bilingual book</h3>
<p>For those times when reading in Spanish just isn’t enough, you should try picking up a book that uses "parallel text" — a format in which Spanish is printed on one page and the English translation is written on the next page.</p>

<p>This will allow you to get the reading practice you need in Spanish and quickly get answers when you can’t seem to figure out the corresponding word or phrase in English without the need to reach for a dictionary every time.</p>


<h3>Change the language on all your devices to Spanish</h3>
<p>Spanish immersion is thought to be one of the most effective ways of enhancing your learning. But what if you can’t drop it all and move to Spain? Well, you just have to think of other ways of immersing yourself in the Spanish language. And if you’re like most people, the amount of time you spend online means that changing your computer settings to Spanish is a pretty good start. Change the language across all your devices to ensure no cheating. Do it for a week and see the difference.</p>


<h3>Read Spanish subtitles while watching TV</h3>
<p>Make the most of your downtime by adding a bit of Spanish reading practice into your TV-watching hours. By switching on Spanish subtitles, you can match the Spanish words with the spoken English. So whether you’re studying hard (pausing the TV to ensure you really grasp each sentence) or just letting the words wash over you, you’ll be boosting your knowledge by picking up the style of Spanish that’s used in everyday life. Bonus points if the spoken and written words are both in Spanish.</p>

<h2><strong>Tips for Learning Spanish by Writing</strong></h2>

<h3>Translate your work or study emails into Spanish</h3>
<p>Whether it’s at work or school, most of us will put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) at least once a day. Be it an email, a bit of homework or a scribbled note to a loved one, use that fresh material to boost your Spanish.</p>

<p><strong>In practice:</strong> Pick one piece of writing from your day and translate it into Spanish. To look up unknown words, use <a href="https://www.wordreference.com/"><i>Word Reference</i></a> or <a href="https://www.spanishdict.com/"><i>SpanishDict</i></a>.</p>


<h3>Find a penpal</h3>
<p>If you’d prefer to have more purpose to your writing than translating your work emails, consider searching for an overseas penpal. Getting a penpal is a great opportunity to practice while swapping cultural details with your new foreign friend.</p>

<p><strong>In practice:</strong> The internet makes it incredibly easy to connect with a penpal who has a similar language level and interests as you, and websites like <a href="https://www.interpals.net/"><i>Interpals</i></a> will help you get started.</p>


<h3>Read a Spanish children’s book</h3>
<p>Reading Spanish books and magazines is an excellent way to enhance your reading skills and the same methodology can be used to improve your Spanish writing. Children’s books are a great place to start because the language will be basic enough that you can read with relative ease.</p>

<h2><strong>Tips for Learning Spanish by Listening</strong></h2>

<h3>Listen to Spanish radio</h3>
<p>Whether you’re the kind of person who likes the radio warbling on in the background or you prefer to have dedicated stints of listening to your favorite talk show, Spanish radio is one of the most useful forms of improving your Spanish listening without having to get out of your armchair.</p>

<p><strong>In practice:</strong> <a href="https://tunein.com/"><i>TuneIn Radio</i></a> is a free resource online that will help you pick a station where you can listen to Spanish radio for free. Don’t forget to set a listening schedule so you build up your listening skills over time.</p>


<h3>Watch Telenovas</h3>
<p>On paper, telenovelas might feel like the visual equivalent to listening to Spanish radio, but this method of learning Spanish has the significant advantage that you’re much more likely to get addicted to a telenovela than a radio show. Dramatic storylines, quirky characters, mesmerizing acting and, let’s be honest, the occasional bit of questionable facial hair, all stack up to make you want to sit down and binge your way through show after show, picking up Spanish as you go.</p>

<p><strong>In practice:</strong> <a href="https://www.fluentu.com/blog/spanish/best-telenovelas-for-learning-spanish/"><i>“Maria la del Barrio“</i></a> is one of the most popular telenovelas in the world (180 countries) but you’ll find plenty of others <a href="https://www.fluentu.com/blog/spanish/learn-spanish-telenovela/">here</a>.</p>


<h3>Listen to Music</h3>
<p>Spanish covers of your favorite songs are best for Spanish learning as you already know the lyrics in English, so your brain makes the connection between the Spanish words and the meanings. You could also just listen to Spanish music which is also very good!</p>

<h2><strong>Tips for Learning Spanish by Speaking</strong></h2>

<h3>Join a language exchange group and meet in person</h3>
<p>For many new language learners, having the confidence to speak can be one of the hardest parts about Spanish, and may be the last part you tackle, but there’s no escaping it. Instead of waiting until you’re in a situation in a foreign country trying to order food, get some practice with native speakers at a language exchange. Most people are very sympathetic at meetups—they’re trying to achieve the same goal in your native language.</p>

<p><strong>In practice:</strong> Language exchanges are reasonably prolific. Check out <a href="https://www.meetup.com/"><i>Meetup</i></a> to see if there’s one being hosted near you and if not, why not start your own?</p>


<h3>Find someone to chat with online</h3>
<p>Not ready for a real-life situation just yet? Consider taking a step in the right direction with an online chat. Although it would be impolite to cut your conversation off mid-Spanish sentence, online chats do provide a pretty easy escape route (button) when you’re all talked out.</p>

<p><strong>In practice:</strong> The free community <a href="https://www.meetup.com/"><i>How Do You Do</i></a> has been set up for language learners to meet and chat online.</p>
